<h1>Job Submitted</h1>

<p>Your job has been submitted to the server!
Your job ID is {{ job.name }}.</p>

<p>The job is currently running. When it is complete, results will be found
here - simply refresh or bookmark this page.</p>

{%- if job.email %}
<p>You will be notified at {{ job.email }} when job results are available.</p>
{%- endif %}

<p>You can check on the status of all jobs at the

<p>The estimated execution time per request is ~1 min, depending on the
server load.</p>

for more than 12 hours, please <a href="{{ url_for("contact") }}">contact us</a>.</p>
