<h4>General</h4>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="jobname"></a>Job Name</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
The Job Name is used to identify the status in the queue and to display the
results. 
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="modkey"></a>Modeller Key</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
To use the evaluation server, input of the MODELLER license key is required. For further
information, please consult <a href="https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html">https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html</a>.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="email"></a>Email Address</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
An email will be sent to the input email address, once the calculations are
finished.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="pdb_file"></a>Model File</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
Input model file in PDB or mmCIF format (see <a href="https://www.wwpdb.org/">https://www.wwpdb.org/</a>)
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="alignment_file"></a>Alignment File</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
Optional input alignment file in PIR format (<a href="https://salilab.org/modeller/9.17/manual/node496.html">see MODELLER manual</a>). 
Please note that the second field in line two of the structure entry should
contain a pdb code (without chain) of a template file currently available in
the PDB database. 
<br /><br />The TSVMod score
is significantly more reliable if:</p>
<ul>
<li>TSVMod receives a model and an alignment file</li>
<li>The template PDB code or a closely related template can be found in the TSVMod training set</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="seq_ident"></a>Sequence Identity</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
The calculation of the GA341 score requires the target-template sequence
identity. For model files produced by MODELLER, this information will be taken
from the PDB or mmCIF header, so this field can be left blank.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h4>TSVMod</h4>
<p>TSVMod predicts the RMSD and the Native Overlap (at 3.5 &Aring; cutoff) of
a model with its native structure, using a support vector machine (SVM).<br />
&nbsp;<br /></p>
<h5><a name="predrmsd"></a>Predicted RMSD</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
The predicted root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) between the coordinates of
the C&alpha; atoms in the model and in the native structure.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="predno35"></a>Predicted Native Overlap</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
Fraction of model C&alpha; atoms that are predicted to be within 3.5 &Aring;
of their positions in the native structure.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="matchtype"></a>Match Type</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>MatchByTemplate: Training set is based on the template structure, or a closely
related template structure (95% sequence identity). This match type returns
the most reliable results. It can only be used with an input alignment file in
MODELLER-style PIR format, and if the template has been used in the training
set.  </li>
<li>MatchBySS: Training set is based on similar secondary structure features. This
match type is used in two ways: with all features, and with a reduced feature
set. If an alignment file is given, this match type is used if the template
PDB file can not be found in the training set, and the information of templates
with similar features is used instead. Without an alignment file, only a
reduced set of features is used in the SVM, resulting in the least reliable
prediction. </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="features"></a>Features</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>All: all available z-scores are used in the SVM </li>
<li>Reduced: for lack of sufficiently similar structures in the training set, a reduced set of
z-scores is used to compute the results.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="relaxcount"></a>Relax Count</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
The standard relax count is 1. If not enough similar structures are found in
the training set, the default boundaries are relaxed incrementally. 
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="setsize"></a>Set Size</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
Number of similar structures used to compute the results
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h4>DOPE</h4>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="z-dope"></a>z-DOPE</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
Using probability theory, we derive an atomic distance- dependent
statistical potential from a sample of native structures that does not depend
on any adjustable parameters (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy, or DOPE).
DOPE is based on an improved reference state that corresponds to
noninteracting atoms in a homogeneous sphere with the radius dependent on a
sample native structure; it thus accounts for the finite and spherical shape
of the native structures. The evaluation server reports the normalized z-DOPE
score. 
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="dope_profile"></a>DOPE Profile</h5>
<p>
DOPE energy profile, smoothed over a 15 residue window, normalized over the
number of DOPE restraints acting on each residue. A plot is shown; the raw
profile files can also be downloaded (each is a simple text file containing
the residue number in the leftmost column and the DOPE score in the rightmost
column).
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h4>GA341</h4>
<p>
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="ga341"></a>GA341</h5>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>
Score for the reliability of a model, derived from statistical potentials
(<a href="https://salilab.org/pdf/Melo_ProteinSci_2002.pdf">F. Melo,
R. Sanchez, A. Sali, 2002</a>). A model is predicted to be reliable when the
model score is higher than a pre-specified cutoff (0.7). A reliable model has
a probability of the correct fold that is larger than 95%. A fold is correct
when at least 30% of its C&alpha; atoms superpose within 3.5&Aring;
of their correct positions.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="z-surf"></a>z-surf</h5>
<p>
A surface statistical potential that contributes to GA341.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="z-pair"></a>z-pair</h5>
<p>
A pairwise statistical potential that contributes to GA341.
</p>
&nbsp;<br />
<h5><a name="z-combi"></a>z-combi</h5>
<p>
A combined statistical potential that contributes to GA341.
